# Dataset:
I used a spambase dataset. The Spambase dataset contains 4,601 instances and 58 attributes. Each instance represents an email, with attributes that reflect various aspects of the message's content. The target variable indicates whether the email is spam (1 or 0).

# Feature Exraction Phase:
The feature extraction stage was performed by CNN algorithm.

# Recognition Phase:
This phase focuses on recognizing spam emails. The recognition phase makes use of SVM, decision tree, and KNN algorithm classifires.
